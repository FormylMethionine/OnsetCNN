# Musical Onset Detection using CNN

Inspired by [chrisdonahue/ddc](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/ddc).

The goal of this project is to detect musical "events", or onsets from an audio
file using short term Fourier analysis and CNN.
The dataset used comes from rhythm game, more specifically Stepmania.

The long term goal is to be able to automatically create files for Stepmania
from the audio file.

**WIP**

## To do:
- split the files between train, test, and eval datasets
- Train the network for longer times
